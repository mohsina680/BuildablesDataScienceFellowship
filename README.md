# Buildables Data Science Fellowship

The **Buildables Data Science Fellowship** is a 12-week, project-based learning program designed to help you develop strong, practical data science skills through real-world projects. It covers the complete data science workflow — from exploratory data analysis to model deployment — using Python and industry-standard tools.



## 📊 About the Fellowship

This repository contains all the materials, Jupyter notebooks, exercises, assignments, and project templates used throughout the fellowship.  
Each week focuses on a different stage of the data science lifecycle and includes hands-on tasks to help you apply what you learn.

Whether you're a beginner entering the field or a developer looking to upskill, this fellowship is designed to give you a strong foundation in applied data science.
